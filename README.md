OMG just walked out of The Accountant 2 — and let me tell you, my brain is frizzled like an egg on a hot sidewalk in July 😂. Still picking popcorn crumbs off my shirt, gah! Atmosphere was loud, like, people whispering like they ain’t got no inside voice? Rude. But about the   — yeah okay, it’s wild how numbers crunch and then suddenly you’re in some John Wick meets Sudoku situation.

There’s this one scene — guns blazing and literally the only thought in my mind was like “what's Fisher-Price brands doing in here??” colors all cartoony during some shootout, I dunno why!

Like they threw numbers and explosions in a blender, real smoothie-like genius. My back's killing me though, this theater needs better chairs!

Overall don’t know if I’d re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 or invite a friend for a round 2, ya know. But maybe that's just the caffeine talkin’.
